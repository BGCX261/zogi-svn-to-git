#summary The time entity

The [time] entity is used to represent the current time of the server.  Clients can use this value to check that their own local clocks are a reasonable match to the servers time or to discover their current difference from GMT time.   If the user has configured a time zone on the server the server will also provide, via the *userTime*, *isDST*, and *offset* attributes, its perception of the  clients current time.  If the user has not configured a time zone the *userTime* and offset attributes will be zero as the server will assume the client is operating in GMT time.

To retrieve the current [time] entity perform a [searchForObjects] with an entity name of "Time".  The detail, flags, and criteria fields are ignored for a [time] request.  The result will be an array of a single [time] entity.

*NOTE:* [time] is a [UnderstandingEntities transient entity].

For retrieving the time zones known to the server see the documentation on the [timeZone] entity.

  server = xmlrpclib.Server('http://{USER}:{PASSWORD}@{HOST}/zidestore/so/{USER}/')
  pprint.pprint(server.zogi.searchForObjects('Time', '', 0))
