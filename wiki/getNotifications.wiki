#summary The getNotifications method

= Important =

[getNotifications] is an administrative function;  invoking this method with any credentials other than those of the [OpenGroupware.org] superuser will result in an exception.

Once an [Appointment] is qualified for notification and the [notification] entities are returned to the client the "notificationTime" attribute of the [Appointment] is cleared.

= Details =

The [getNotifications] method returns a [notification] entity for each pending notification.  

  * The minimum notification time is 10 minutes.  
  * The maximum notification time before an appointment is 8 days.

For site-specific notification methods it is recommended to call [getNotifications] at a regular interval of less than 10 minutes with a start date of the current time minus the poll interval and an end time of the current time plus nine days.

= Example =

{{{
#!/usr/bin/env python
import xmlrpclib, time, pprint

server = xmlrpclib.Server('http://{USER}:{PASSWORD}@{HOST}/zidestore/so/{USER}/')
result = server.zogi.getNotifications('2007-09-14 13:35', '2007-09-23 13:35')
pprint.pprint(result)
}}}
