#summary The acl entity

= Introduction =

The [acl] entity encodes an access control rule.  Access Control Rules (acl) are a generic way of controlling access to most objects.  In OpenGroupware the [Contact], [Enterprise], [Project], [Team], and [BLOB] entities all support ACLs

*IMPORTANT:*  The [acl] is one of the two entity types that can under go [UnderstandingEntities transformation];  specific conditions can transform an [acl] into an [assignment].  Read [UnderstandingEntities Understanding Entities] for specific information.

= Details =

Each [acl] applies to another specific object, either a [Contact] or a [Team].  The "targetObjectId" is guaranteed to be unique within a set of ACLs.  The "parentObjectId" is the object for which the ACL rules controls access.

In order to eliminate an ACL you must put it with a blank operation (permit no operations).  This will delete the ACL.  ACLs operate in this way so that they are deliberately difficult to remove by accident.

When storing an ACL to the server only the "targetObjectId" and "operations" keys must be provided.  Other keys will be silently ignored by the ACL update routines.

= Attributes =

  * *operations* - A string encoding of the operations granted on *parentObjectId* to the *targetObjectId* entity.  Order is not relevant and each character denotes a specific privilege.
    * *r* - Read
    * *w* - Write
  * *parentObjectId* - The *objectId* of the entity to which the [acl] applies.
  * *targetEntityName* - The type of object referred to by the *targetObjectId* attribute.  This value is provided as a convenience for thin platforms such as a web application that do not maintain a persistent cache of objects.  This value will be either "Contact" for a user account or "Team" if permissions where granted on the basis of [Team] membership.
  * *targetObjectId* - The *objectId* of the entity to which permissions have been granted.
