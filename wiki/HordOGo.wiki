    * Status: Not yet planned.
    * Questions: What events should appear on the calendar?  Should this be just the user's appointments or use their panel?
  * [http://www.horde.org/nag/ NAG] (todo)
    * Status: Not yet planned.
    * Questions: NAG is a *very* simple application, and not very "groupware" like.  It may ultimately not be possible to rationally map the meager functionality of the NAG onto OpenGroupware's powerful task application.

    * Status: Not yet planned.
    * Questions: There isn't currently a notes / journal application in OpenGroupware.  Therefore Mnemo probably won't have a driver.
