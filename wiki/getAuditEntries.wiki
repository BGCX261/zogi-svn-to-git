#summary getAuditEntries

= Introduction =

The getAuditEntries was introduced into the zOGI API as of r920 / 2008-03-05.  That is equivalent to OpenGroupware r2093;  use of this method requires r2092 even if zOGI is compiled separately.   The results of the method is an array of up to 150 [logEntry] entities.  If more entries are desired the client should page the results by calling the method again with the highest *objectId* received.

The intended purpose of this is to allow external systems to track changes to the OGo data; see [http://docs.opengroupware.org/Members/whitemice/OGoMojo/MOGIMon-HOWTO/view MOGIMon] for a primitive example.  The getAuditEntries permits such functionality *without* have to create a direct/backdoor connection to the OpenGroupware database.

*Only the OpenGroupware super user (root) can call getAuditEntries.*

= Example =
