#summary The unflagFavorites method

= Introduction =

The [unflagFavorites] method removes the favorite status from the provided objects.  The single parameter may be an array of objectIds or a CSV string of objectIds.  If one of the provided objectIds is not currently a favorite than it is silently ignored.

A [Contact] or [Enterprises] favorite status can also be modified when the object is stored via the [putObject] method.  Simply include the "favorite" or "unfavorite" flags in the *FLAGS* array key when storing the object.  [unflagFavorites] is intended for when numerous objects need to be flagged as not-favorite and it avoids bumping the version number of the object's whose favorite status is modified.  For adding favorite status on a collection of objects use the [flagFavorites] method.

= Details =

Objects that are marked as favorites can be retrieved with the [getFavoritesByType] method.

OpenGroupware currently only stores favorites for Projects, Enterprises, and Contacts.  If you attempt to favorite an object of an unsupported type an exception will occur.

= Example =
