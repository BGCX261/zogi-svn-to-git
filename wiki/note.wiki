#summary The note entity

= Example =

[note] entities exist in the NOTES special key of [Appointment] and [Project] entities.  The NOTES special key of [Task] entities contains [taskNotation] entities, not [note]s.

*NOTE:* As of ZideStore r2102 / zOGI r943 the entityName of the note entity is returned as "note" and not "Note".  Prior to this the Wiki and the code were inconsistent.
