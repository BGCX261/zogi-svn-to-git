#summary The getObjectById method

The [getObjectById] method permits a single object to be requested from the server.  [getObjectById] is simply the singular form of [getObjectsById].  If possible it is recommended that you retrieve all the object you need for an operation in a single request using [getObjectsById].

The first parameter is the object id as a number or string and the second parameter is the level of detail to retrieve.

*NOTE:* If you request an objectId that does not exist you will receive an [Unknown] entity as a response.
